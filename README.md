# Jantahack-covid-19-Av-Hackathon-
The following project was carried out to predict the stay period for covid-19 patients wrt to various hospital data being collected, including the information related to hospital facility, hospital region, patient region etc, following project was the part of national level hackathon conducted by 'analytics vidhya' with the use of appropriate data wrangling, feature engineering and model selection with parameter tuning the rank came out to be '219' with model score of '42.30'

Few Project Highlights:

1. For following project a feature engineering was carried out on a feature named 'region code' which contained unique region codes for covid patients being admitted, with feature enginnering the region codes with higher value counts was flaged out 'High Zone' so as to represent that pericular region code as high containment zone(i.e it's hi]ghly affected).

2. The null values were filled with the relevance to another column containig different categories, the column 'bed grade' representing the quality of bed had null values which were filled with relevance to the column 'severity of illness' representing different severity of illness. This filled the column null's in a more presice way.
